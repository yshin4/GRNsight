In systems biology, an effective network visualization of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) allows users to derive insights from the data that model these networks. A GRN consists of genes, transcription factors, and the regulatory connections between them which govern the level of expression of mRNA and protein from genes. Although many software applications exist for network visualization, most require installation of stand-alone software, have a complex feature set that novice users find difficult to learn, or are specialized for large networks.  To address this, we have developed GRNsight, a web application and service that fills a niche for visualizing small- to medium-scale GRNs in a way that is simple and intuitive to use, and adds value to the interpretation of GRN modeling results. GRNsight automatically lays out weighted or unweighted network graphs from an Excel workbook containing an adjacency matrix, a Simple Interaction Format (SIF) text file, or a GraphML (XML) file. GRNsight represents genes as nodes and regulatory connections as directed edges with colors, end markers, and thicknesses corresponding to weight values that represent the sign and magnitude of activation or repression of the target gene. GRNsight is written in JavaScript, and builds upon the D3.js visualization library to generate a force-directed graph that responds to changes in force graph parameter sliders. Manual node dragging can be used to refine the visualization. Since the release of GRNsight v1, feedback from peer review and the related GRNmap software modeling team has motivated improvements and new features. In GRNsight v2, the graph bounding box is separated from the viewport and is allowed to expand as far as required for the graph to converge to a steady-state, allowing the force graph parameters to be fully applied.  Because of this change, the ability for the user to zoom and scroll the graph within the viewport was added. The option to restrict the graph to the viewport was also retained. New analysis features include the ability to always or never show edge weight values, the ability to customize the edge thickness normalization factor, and set the threshold for coloring the edges gray. These features facilitate comparison of multiple graphs so that the thicknesses of the edges will be on the same scale and allows the user to gauge the importance of particular regulatory relationships by "graying out" weak connections. Based on feedback from initial usability testing by the GRNmap modeling group and undergraduates in the Biomathematical Modeling course at Loyola Marymount University, GRNsight's visualization features enable the interpretation of weight values more easily than one could from the numerical data alone. GRNsight follows open and test-driven development software engineering best practices, with an exhaustive testing framework consisting of over 230 unit tests for quality control. Future plans include providing different graph layout options, computing and displaying graph statistics, and coloring the nodes to represent each gene's expression over time. The GRNsight application http://dondi.github.io/GRNsight/ and code https://github.com/dondi/GRNsight are available under the open source BSD license.
